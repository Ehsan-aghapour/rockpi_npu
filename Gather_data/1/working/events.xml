    ftrace counters require Linux 3.10 or later; if you do not see ftrace counters in counter configuration, please check your Linux version
    'counter' attribute must start with ftrace_ and be unique
    the regex item in () is the value shown or, if the parentheses are missing, the number of regex matches is counted
    'enable' (optional) is the ftrace event to enable associated with the gator event
    'tracepoint' (optional) same meaning as enable, but will use perf instead of ftrace when using user space gator
    'arg' (optional) used in conjunction with 'tracepoint' to specify the value to show otherwise the number of tracepoint events is counted
